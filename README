[Update]

as3logger will change the way it works...

We are working on a new feature called Margarita. It's a mac app with a clean UI for debug actionscript/mxml/fla based applications.

as3logger will communicate with Margarita and will have all specifications about it, so you can create your own logger to connect with it.

VERSION 0.1 =)

Just sent us an e-mail, if you like this solution and/or want to contribute.
<hello@wemakegoodworks.com> =)

** How to use

Main project file: 
Logger.config(stage);

Then,
Logger.log(String); # Normal log
Logger.log(Error, "error"); # Log an Error
Logger.log(String, "warning"); # Log an Warning


** Next features

br.goodworkinteractive.as3logger.Logger#registerObject(obj:Object);
br.goodworkinteractive.as3logger.Logger#registerDisplayObject(obj:DisplayObject);

br.goodworkinteractive.as3logger.ui.LoggerCommandLine;
br.goodworkinteractive.as3logger.ui.LoggerPanel;
br.goodworkinteractive.as3logger.ui.LoggerMenu;
